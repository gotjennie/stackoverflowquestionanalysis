V<p>This is from a post I made on my blog, answering almost <a href="http://ironzebra.com/news/41/learning-django-where-to-start-and-what-to-know" rel="nofollow noreferrer">exactly same question</a>. It contains many of the answers already given here, as well as some extra advice, and some of it is my personal opinion, and others may differ from me. Hopefully someone finds it useful:</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Build Something</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>The best advice I can give is to start by building something. A typical "Hello world" for Django is a blog website, and I would also recommend starting with that. The Django framework tries to make common tasks extremely easy and simple, and a website with simple blogging functionality is a typical example. A fluent Djangonaut can code up a simple blog website in less than an hour by using all the libraries available, and therefore it's a good place to start and get a feel for how Django does things.</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>The Django Book</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>Of course, before you can just jump in and start coding, you need to get your system up and running with Django, and learn the basics. A great resource for that is the <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Django Book</a>. The authors haven't worked on it in a while or kept it quite up to date (due to its young nature, Django changes quite frequently), but It's freely available online and highly recommended. Read the first few chapters on how to set up your system, how all the parts of Django fit together into the MVC model, and be amazed by how Django does things so simply that other frameworks made unnecisarily tiresome.</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>The Django Tutorials and Documentation</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>There are so many great tutorials on the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Django website</a>, that you'll almost need nothing else once you have the basics of Django down. The documentation is also fantastic, go take a look for yourself.</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Pick a Django Version</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>For a beginner, it will be a good idea to pick a Django version, and stick with it. At the time of this writing, there are two main versions being used by most, Django 1.2 and Django 1.3, as well as the development version (the version that the Django developers work on and test changes in before it gets released as a major version). Don't use the development version when you're starting out - you're bound to run into trouble.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The big thing is that Django has existed for around four or five years now, and much of the tutorials you'll find scattered over Google will be aimed at Django 1.0 and 1.1. That's fine, and mostly not a problem, but Django's added quite a lot of functionality since then that makes most of those tutorials and code snippets obsolete. Try to stick to tutorials that are aimed at your version, where possible.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Once you've picked a version, make sure you always read the correct version of the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Django documentation</a>. You'll see on the right-hand side sidebar and in the url of the page you are on that you can change the version you're looking at. Django's documentaion is truly excellent and far beyond anything else out there, and the authors take great care to specifically state which functions are new to that version, and which are deprecated in later versions. Just make sure you're aware of that, so that you don't waste countless hours trying to make something work that's not available in your version.</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Know what DRY means, and practice it</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>DRY: "Don't Repeat Yourself" is one of the core principles behind Django. If you find yourself copy-pasting anything in Django, there's almost certainly a better way to do it. Most programmers will know from experience why repitition like that is bad, but in short, if something in your code needs to change later on or if you made a mistake somewhere, you only need to change it in one place. That's useful, because if there is more than one place needing change, and you forget about that instance, you'll be introducing errors and bugs into your code.</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Stay away from Class-based views</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>A new addition to Django 1.3 is a whole array of Class-based Generic Views. If you don't know what that means, don't worry. The vast majority of tutorials and books about Django won't make any mention of it, mainly because it is so new. It's a feature that is meant to lessen the repitition in creating views, thereby following the DRY principle. While it does do that to some extent, it also introduces a lot of black magic and the need to frequently go scratch around in the Django source code to see what's going on. For the beginner, that is less than ideal. In addition, the error messages as they are now provided for Class-based views often point you in the completely wrong direction. Stay away from them, and rather use functional views in the beginning, as most tutorials will tell you to. When you're a bit more used to Django and you find the repitition of functional views frustrating, look into Class-based Generic Views.</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Don't start out hosting on Google App Engine</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>While GAE is free and great for scalable Django apps, it also introduces a lot of restrictions on your login process, and the documentation on that is extremely scarce. As a beginner, don't start out with that route, since lots of the normal Django documentation will suddenly not apply, and you won't know what to do. Rather, start with a service like <s><a href="http://ep.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">epio</a></s>, <a href="http://gondor.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gondor.io</a>, or <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoFriendlyWebHosts" rel="nofollow noreferrer">many others</a> . <s>Epio's still in beta, but have a free hosting option as well (up to a certain amount of monthly usage). Developed by two of the Django core developers, I strongly recommend using them - it's comparable to Heroku for Ruby on Rails.</s> Ep.io is closing down, but <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Heroku</a> also recently added a <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/9/28/python_and_django/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python hosting option</a>.</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Use StackOverflow,  Ask questions</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>My final piece of advice is to make use of StackOverflow any time you get stuck. First off, they already have the answer to just about any question you can dream of. If you can't find it on the site, a good way to find the answer to your question is to append "stackoverflow" as part of your google search terms. Otherwise, post a question and let the Django community help you out. It's proven to be my greatest resource in learning the darker sides of Django over the last few years, apart from physically reading the Django code (which you should also do!). Good luck, and enjoy!</p>\u000a

V<p>Python's <code>statistics</code> module is not built for speed, but for precision</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0450/" rel="nofollow">the specs for this module</a>, it appears that</p>\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u000a  <p>The built-in sum can lose accuracy when dealing with floats of wildly\u000a  differing magnitude.  Consequently, the above naive mean fails this\u000a  "torture test"</p>\u000a  \u000a  <p><code>assert mean([1e30, 1, 3, -1e30]) == 1</code></p>\u000a  \u000a  <p>returning 0 instead of 1, a purely computational error of 100%.</p>\u000a  \u000a  <p>Using math.fsum inside mean will make it more accurate with float\u000a  data, but it also has the side-effect of converting any arguments to\u000a  float even when unnecessary.  E.g. we should expect the mean of a list\u000a  of Fractions to be a Fraction, not a float.</p>\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000a<p>Conversely, if we take a look at the implementation of <code>_sum()</code> in this module, the first lines of the method's docstring <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/statistics.py#l119" rel="nofollow">seem to confirm that</a>:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>def _sum(data, start=0):\u000a    """_sum(data [, start]) -&gt; (type, sum, count)\u000a\u000a    Return a high-precision sum of the given numeric data as a fraction,\u000a    together with the type to be converted to and the count of items.\u000a\u000a    [...] """\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>So yeah, <code>statistics</code> implementation of <code>sum</code>, instead of being a simple one-liner call to Python's built-in <code>sum()</code> function, takes about 20 lines by itself with a nested <code>for</code> loop in its body.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>This happens because <code>statistics._sum</code> chooses to guarantee the maximum precision for all types of number it could encounter (even if they widely differ from one another), instead of simply emphasizing speed.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Hence, it appears normal that the built-in <code>sum</code> proves a hundred times faster. The cost of it being a much lower precision in you happen to call it with exotic numbers.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Other options</strong></p>\u000a\u000a<p>If you need to prioritize speed in your algorithms, you should have a look at <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" rel="nofollow">Numpy</a> instead, the algorithms of which being implemented in C.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>NumPy mean is not as precise as <code>statistics</code> by a long shot but it implements (since 2013) a <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/3685" rel="nofollow">routine based on pairwise summation</a> which is better than a naive <code>sum/len</code> (more info in the link).</p>\u000a\u000a<p>However...</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>import numpy as np\u000aimport statistics\u000a\u000anp_mean = np.mean([1e30, 1, 3, -1e30])\u000astatistics_mean = statistics.mean([1e30, 1, 3, -1e30])\u000a\u000aprint('NumPy mean: {}'.format(np_mean))\u000aprint('Statistics mean: {}'.format(statistics_mean))\u000a\u000a&gt; NumPy mean: 0.0\u000a&gt; Statistics mean: 1.0\u000a</code></pre>\u000a

V<p>While Python generators are cool, trying to duplicate them really isn't the best way to go about in Scala. For instance, the following code does the equivalent job to what you want:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre class="lang-scala prettyprint-override"><code>def classStream(clazz: Class[_]): Stream[Class[_]] = clazz match {\u000a  case null =&gt; Stream.empty\u000a  case _ =&gt; (\u000a    clazz \u000a    #:: classStream(clazz.getSuperclass) \u000a    #::: clazz.getInterfaces.toStream.flatMap(classStream) \u000a    #::: Stream.empty\u000a  )\u000a}\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>In it the stream is generated lazily, so it won't process any of the elements until asked for, which you can verify by running this:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre class="lang-scala prettyprint-override"><code>def classStream(clazz: Class[_]): Stream[Class[_]] = clazz match {\u000a  case null =&gt; Stream.empty\u000a  case _ =&gt; (\u000a    clazz \u000a    #:: { println(clazz.toString+": super"); classStream(clazz.getSuperclass) } \u000a    #::: { println(clazz.toString+": interfaces"); clazz.getInterfaces.toStream.flatMap(classStream) } \u000a    #::: Stream.empty\u000a  )\u000a}\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>The result can be converted into an <code>Iterator</code> simply by calling <code>.iterator</code> on the resulting <code>Stream</code>:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>def classIterator(clazz: Class[_]): Iterator[Class[_]] = classStream(clazz).iterator\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>The <code>foo</code> definition, using <code>Stream</code>, would be rendered thus:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre class="lang-scala prettyprint-override"><code>scala&gt; def foo(i: Int): Stream[Int] = i #:: (if (i &gt; 0) foo(i - 1) else Stream.empty)\u000afoo: (i: Int)Stream[Int]\u000a\u000ascala&gt; foo(5) foreach println\u000a5\u000a4\u000a3\u000a2\u000a1\u000a0\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>Another alternative would be concatenating the various iterators, taking care to not pre-compute them. Here's an example, also with debugging messages to help trace the execution:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>def yieldClass(clazz: Class[_]): Iterator[Class[_]] = clazz match {\u000a  case null =&gt; println("empty"); Iterator.empty\u000a  case _ =&gt;\u000a    def thisIterator = { println("self of "+clazz); Iterator(clazz) }\u000a    def superIterator = { println("super of "+clazz); yieldClass(clazz.getSuperclass) }\u000a    def interfacesIterator = { println("interfaces of "+clazz); clazz.getInterfaces.iterator flatMap yieldClass }\u000a    thisIterator ++ superIterator ++ interfacesIterator\u000a}\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>This is pretty close to your code. Instead of <code>sudoYield</code>, I have definitions, and then I just concatenate them as I wish.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>So, while this is a non-answer, I just think you are barking up the wrong tree here. Trying to write Python in Scala is bound to be unproductive. Work harder at the Scala idioms that accomplish the same goals.</p>\u000a

V<p>One should not think too hard about it. It's ultimately better for the mental health and longevity of the individual.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The curious situation with Numpy scalar-types was bore out of the fact that there is no graceful and consistent way to degrade the 1x1 matrix to scalar types. Even though mathematically they are the same thing, they are handled by very different code.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>If you've been doing any amount of scientific code, ultimately you'd want things like <code>max(a)</code> to work on matrices of all sizes, even scalars. Mathematically, this is a perfectly sensible thing to expect. However for programmers this means that whatever presents scalars in Numpy should have the .shape and .ndim attirbute, so at least the ufuncs don't have to do explicit type checking on its input for the 21 possible scalar types in Numpy. </p>\u000a\u000a<p>On the other hand, they should also work with existing Python libraries that <em>does</em> do explicit type-checks on scalar type. This is a dilemma, since a Numpy ndarray have to individually change its type when they've been reduced to a scalar, and there is no way of knowing whether that has occurred without it having do checks on all access. Actually going that route would probably make bit ridiculously slow to work with by scalar type standards.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The Numpy developer's solution is to inherit from both ndarray and Python scalars for its own scalary type, so that all scalars also have .shape, .ndim, .T, etc etc. The 1x1 matrix will still be there, but its use will be discouraged if you know you'll be dealing with a scalar. While this should work fine in theory, occasionally you could still see some places where they missed with the paint roller, and the ugly innards are exposed for all to see:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from numpy import *\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; a = array(1)\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; b = int_(1)\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; a.ndim\u000a0\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; b.ndim\u000a0\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; a[...]\u000aarray(1)\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; a[()]\u000a1\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; b[...]\u000aarray(1)\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; b[()]\u000a1\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>There's really no reason why <code>a[...]</code> and <code>a[()]</code> should return different things, but it does. There are proposals in place to change this, but looks like they forgot to finish the job for 1x1 arrays.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>A potentially bigger, and possibly non-resolvable issue, is the fact that Numpy scalars are immutable. Therefore "spraying" a scalar into a ndarray, mathematically the adjoint operation of collapsing an array into a scalar, is a PITA to implement. You can't actually grow a Numpy scalar, it cannot by definition be cast into an ndarray, even though <code>newaxis</code> mysteriously works on it:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b[0,1,2,3] = 1\u000aTraceback (most recent call last):\u000a  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\u000aTypeError: 'numpy.int32' object does not support item assignment\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; b[newaxis]\u000aarray([1])\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>In Matlab, growing the size of a scalar is a perfectly acceptable and brainless operation. In Numpy you have to stick jarring <code>a = array(a)</code> everywhere you <em>think</em> you'd have the possibility of starting with a scalar and ending up with an array. I understand why Numpy has to be this way to play nice with Python, but that doesn't change the fact that many new switchers are deeply confused about this. Some have explicit memory of struggling with this behaviour and eventually persevering, while others who are too far gone are generally left with some deep shapeless mental scar that frequently haunts their most innocent dreams. It's an ugly situation for all.</p>\u000a

V<p><strong>EDIT 12.11.2013</strong> - This answer is very old. It is still valid and correct, but people looking at this should prefer the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax">new format syntax</a>.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>You can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting">string formatting</a> like this:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print '%5s' % 'aa'\u000a   aa\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; print '%5s' % 'aaa'\u000a  aaa\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; print '%5s' % 'aaaa'\u000a aaaa\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; print '%5s' % 'aaaaa'\u000aaaaaa\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>Basically:</p>\u000a\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>the <code>%</code> character informs python it will have to substitute something to a token</li>\u000a<li>the <code>s</code> character informs python the token will be a string</li>\u000a<li>the <code>5</code> (or whatever number you wish) informs python to pad the string with spaces up to 5 characters.</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a\u000a<p>In your specific case a possible implementation could look like:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dict_ = {'a': 1, 'ab': 1, 'abc': 1}\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in dict_.items():\u000a...     print 'value %3s - num of occurances = %d' % item # %d is the token of integers\u000a... \u000avalue   a - num of occurances = 1\u000avalue  ab - num of occurances = 1\u000avalue abc - num of occurances = 1\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>SIDE NOTE:</strong> Just wondered if you are aware of the existence of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html"><code>itertools</code> module</a>. For example you could obtain a list of all your combinations in one line with:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [''.join(perm) for i in range(1, len(s)) for perm in it.permutations(s, i)]\u000a['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'ab', 'ac', 'ad', 'ba', 'bc', 'bd', 'ca', 'cb', 'cd', 'da', 'db', 'dc', 'abc', 'abd', 'acb', 'acd', 'adb', 'adc', 'bac', 'bad', 'bca', 'bcd', 'bda', 'bdc', 'cab', 'cad', 'cba', 'cbd', 'cda', 'cdb', 'dab', 'dac', 'dba', 'dbc', 'dca', 'dcb']\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>and you could get the number of occurrences by using <code>combinations</code> in conjunction with <code>count()</code>.</p>\u000a

V<p>One of the fastest ways to make many with replacement samples from an unchanging list is the alias method.  The core intuition is that we can create a set of equal-sized bins for the weighted list that can be indexed very efficiently through bit operations, to avoid a binary search.  It will turn out that, done correctly, we will need to only store two items from the original list per bin, and thus can represent the split with a single percentage.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Let's us take the example of five equally weighted choices, <code>(a:1, b:1, c:1, d:1, e:1)</code></p>\u000a\u000a<p>To create the alias lookup:</p>\u000a\u000a<ol>\u000a<li><p>Normalize the weights such that they sum to <code>1.0</code>.  <code>(a:0.2 b:0.2 c:0.2 d:0.2 e:0.2)</code>  This is the probability of choosing each weight.</p></li>\u000a<li><p>Find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to the number of variables, and create this number of partitions, <code>|p|</code>.  Each partition represents a probability mass of <code>1/|p|</code>.  In this case, we create <code>8</code> partitions, each able to contain <code>0.125</code>.</p></li>\u000a<li><p>Take the variable with the least remaining weight, and place as much of it's mass as possible in an empty partition.  In this example, we see that <code>a</code> fills the first partition.  <code>(p1{a|null,1.0},p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,p8)</code> with <code>(a:0.075, b:0.2 c:0.2 d:0.2 e:0.2)</code></p></li>\u000a<li><p>If the partition is not filled, take the variable with the most weight, and fill the partition with that variable.  </p></li>\u000a</ol>\u000a\u000a<p>Repeat steps 3 and 4, until none of the weight from the original partition need be assigned to the list.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>For example, if we run another iteration of 3 and 4, we see </p>\u000a\u000a<p><code>(p1{a|null,1.0},p2{a|b,0.6},p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,p8)</code> with <code>(a:0, b:0.15 c:0.2 d:0.2 e:0.2)</code> left to be assigned</p>\u000a\u000a<p>At runtime:</p>\u000a\u000a<ol>\u000a<li><p>Get a <code>U(0,1)</code> random number, say binary <code>0.001100000</code></p></li>\u000a<li><p>bitshift it <code>lg2(p)</code>, finding the index partition.  Thus, we shift it by <code>3</code>, yielding <code>001.1</code>, or position 1, and thus partition 2.</p></li>\u000a<li><p>If the partition is split, use the decimal portion of the shifted random number to decide the split. In this case, the value is <code>0.5</code>, and <code>0.5 &lt; 0.6</code>, so return <code>a</code>.</p></li>\u000a</ol>\u000a\u000a<p><a href="http://prxq.wordpress.com/2006/04/17/the-alias-method/" rel="noreferrer">Here is some code and another explanation</a>, but unfortunately it doesn't use the bitshifting technique, nor have I actually verified it.</p>\u000a

V<p>Unfortunately, you need to manually construct the query parameters, because as far as I know, there is no built-in <code>bind</code> method for binding a <code>list</code> to an <code>IN</code> clause, similar to Hibernate's <code>setParameterList()</code>.

V<p>I recommend against putting much JavaScript in your Django templates - it tends to be hard to write and debug, particularly as your project expands. Instead, try writing all of your JavaScript in a separate script file which your template loads and simply including just a JSON data object in the template. This allows you to do things like run your entire JavaScript app through something like <a href="http://www.jslint.com" rel="noreferrer">JSLint</a>, minify it, etc. and you can test it with a static HTML file without any dependencies on your Django app. Using a library like simplejson also saves you the time spent writing tedious serialization code.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>If you aren't assuming that you're building an AJAX app this might simply be done like this:</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In the view:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>from django.utils import simplejson\u000a\u000a\u000adef view(request, \u2026):\u000a    js_data = simplejson.dumps(my_dict)\u000a    \u2026\u000a    render_template_to_response("my_template.html", {"my_data": js_data, \u2026})\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>In the template:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;\u000a    data_from_django = {{ my_data }};\u000a    widget.init(data_from_django);\u000a&lt;/script&gt;\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>Note that the type of data matters: if <code>my_data</code> is a simple number or a string from a controlled source which doesn't contain HTML, such as a formatted date, no special handling is required. If it's possible to have untrusted data provided by a user you will need to sanitize it using something like the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#escape" rel="noreferrer">escape</a> or <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#escapejs" rel="noreferrer">escapejs</a> filters and ensure that your JavaScript handles the data safely to avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" rel="noreferrer">cross-site scripting</a> attacks. </p>\u000a\u000a<p>As far as dates go, you might also want to think about how you pass dates around. I've almost always found it easiest to pass them as Unix timestamps:</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In Django:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>time_t = time.mktime(my_date.timetuple())\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>In JavaScript, assuming you've done something like <code>time_t = {{ time_t }}</code> with the results of the snippet above:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>my_date = new Date();\u000amy_date.setTime(time_t*1000);\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>Finally, pay attention to UTC - you'll want to have the Python and Django date functions exchange data in UTC to avoid embarrassing shifts from the user's local time.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>EDIT : Note that the setTime in javascript is in millisecond whereas the output of time.mktime is seconds. That's why we need to multiply by 1000</p>\u000a

V<p>Given the popularity of Python, at first I was disappointed that there was no complete answer to this question to be found. It took me a fair amount of reading different answers on this board, as well as other resources, to get it right. I thought I might share the result for future reference and perhaps review; I'm by no means a cryptography expert! However, the code below appears to work seamlessly:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>from hashlib import md5\u000afrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\u000afrom Crypto import Random\u000a\u000adef derive_key_and_iv(password, salt, key_length, iv_length):\u000a    d = d_i = ''\u000a    while len(d) &lt; key_length + iv_length:\u000a        d_i = md5(d_i + password + salt).digest()\u000a        d += d_i\u000a    return d[:key_length], d[key_length:key_length+iv_length]\u000a\u000adef encrypt(in_file, out_file, password, key_length=32):\u000a    bs = AES.block_size\u000a    salt = Random.new().read(bs - len('Salted__'))\u000a    key, iv = derive_key_and_iv(password, salt, key_length, bs)\u000a    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)\u000a    out_file.write('Salted__' + salt)\u000a    finished = False\u000a    while not finished:\u000a        chunk = in_file.read(1024 * bs)\u000a        if len(chunk) == 0 or len(chunk) % bs != 0:\u000a            padding_length = (bs - len(chunk) % bs) or bs\u000a            chunk += padding_length * chr(padding_length)\u000a            finished = True\u000a        out_file.write(cipher.encrypt(chunk))\u000a\u000adef decrypt(in_file, out_file, password, key_length=32):\u000a    bs = AES.block_size\u000a    salt = in_file.read(bs)[len('Salted__'):]\u000a    key, iv = derive_key_and_iv(password, salt, key_length, bs)\u000a    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)\u000a    next_chunk = ''\u000a    finished = False\u000a    while not finished:\u000a        chunk, next_chunk = next_chunk, cipher.decrypt(in_file.read(1024 * bs))\u000a        if len(next_chunk) == 0:\u000a            padding_length = ord(chunk[-1])\u000a            chunk = chunk[:-padding_length]\u000a            finished = True\u000a        out_file.write(chunk)\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>Usage:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>with open(in_filename, 'rb') as in_file, open(out_filename, 'wb') as out_file:\u000a    encrypt(in_file, out_file, password)\u000awith open(in_filename, 'rb') as in_file, open(out_filename, 'wb') as out_file:\u000a    decrypt(in_file, out_file, password)\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>If you see a chance to improve on this or extend it to be more flexible (e.g. make it work without salt, or provide Python 3 compatibility), please feel free to do so.</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Update</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>There was a bug in here that caused the last bytes of the original file to be discarded if they happened to have the same value as the padding bytes!</p>\u000a

V<p>From the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literal-concatenation" rel="noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u000a  <p>Multiple adjacent string literals (delimited by whitespace), possibly using different quoting conventions, are allowed, and their meaning is the same as their concatenation. Thus, "hello" 'world' is equivalent to "helloworld".</p>\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000a<hr>\u000a\u000a<p>Statement 3 doesn't work because:</p>\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u000a  <p>The \u2018+\u2019 operator must be used to concatenate string expressions at run time.</p>\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000a<p>Notice that the title of the subheader in the docs is  "string literal concatenation" too. This only works for string literals, not other objects.</p>\u000a\u000a<hr>\u000a\u000a<p>There's probably no difference. If there is, it's probably extremely tiny and nothing that anyone should worry about.</p>\u000a\u000a<hr>\u000a\u000a<p>Also, understand that there can be dangers to this:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(bar, baz=None):\u000a...     return bar\u000a... \u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; foo("bob"\u000a... "bill")\u000a'bobbill'\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>This is a perfect example of where <em>Errors should never pass silently.</em> What if I wanted <code>"bill"</code> to be the argument <code>baz</code>? I have forgotton a comma, but no error is raised. Instead, concatenation has taken place.</p>\u000a

V<p>Using <code>yield</code> turns a function into a <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators" rel="noreferrer">generator</a>. A generator is a specialized type of <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types" rel="noreferrer">iterator</a>. <code>for</code> always loops over iterables, taking each element in turn and assigning it to the name(s) you listed.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><code>spinning_cursor()</code> returns a generator, the code inside <code>spinning_cursor()</code> doesn't actually run until you start iterating over the generator. Iterating over a generator means the code in the function is executed until it comes across a <code>yield</code> statement, at which point the result of the expression there is returned as the next value and execution is paused again.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The <code>for</code> loop does just that, it'll call the equivalent of <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#next" rel="noreferrer"><code>next()</code></a> on the generator, until the generator signals it is done by raising <code>StopIteration</code> (which happens when the function returns). Each return value of <code>next()</code> is assigned, in turn, to <code>c</code>.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>You can see this by creating the generator on in the Python prompt:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def spinning_cursor():\u000a...     cursor='/-\u005c|'\u000a...     i = 0\u000a...     while 1:\u000a...         yield cursor[i]\u000a...         i = (i + 1) % len(cursor)\u000a... \u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; sc = spinning_cursor()\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; sc\u000a&lt;generator object spinning_cursor at 0x107a55eb0&gt;\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; next(sc)\u000a'/'\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; next(sc)\u000a'-'\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; next(sc)\u000a'\u005c\u005c'\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; next(sc)\u000a'|'\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>This specific generator never returns, so <code>StopIteration</code> is never raised and the <code>for</code> loop will go on forever unless you kill the script.</p>\u000a

V<p>Part of the problem here is that the strings usually used to represent timezones are not actually unique. "EST" only means "America/New_York" to people in North America. This is a limitation in the C time API, and the Python solution is\u2026 to add full tz features in some future version any day now, if anyone is willing to write the PEP.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>You <em>can</em> format and parse a timezone as an offset, but that loses daylight savings/summer time information (e.g., you can't distinguish "America/Phoenix" from "America/Los_Angeles" in the summer). You can format a timezone as a 3-letter abbreviation, but you can't parse it back from that.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>If you want something that's fuzzy and ambiguous but usually what you want, you need a third-party library like <code>dateutil</code>.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>If you want something that's actually unambiguous, just append the actual tz name to the local datetime string yourself, and split it back off on the other end:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>d = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.timezone("America/New_York"))\u000adtz_string = d.strftime(fmt) + ' ' + "America/New_York"\u000a\u000ad_string, tz_string = dtz_string.rsplit(' ', 1)\u000ad2 = datetime.datetime.strptime(d_string, fmt)\u000atz2 = pytz.timezone(tz_string)\u000a\u000aprint dtz_string \u000aprint d2.strftime(fmt) + ' ' + tz_string\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>Or\u2026 halfway between those two, you're already using the <code>pytz</code> library, which can parse (according to some arbitrary but well-defined disambiguation rules) formats like "EST". So, if you really want to, you can leave the <code>%Z</code> in on the formatting side, then pull it off and parse it with <code>pytz.timezone()</code> before passing the rest to <code>strptime</code>.</p>\u000a

V<p>I believe the truest answer is that modular blueprints shouldn't concern themselves directly with data access, but instead rely on the application providing a compatible implementation.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>So given your example blueprint.</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>from flask import current_app, Blueprint, render_template\u000a\u000aflat_pages = Blueprint('flat_pages', __name__, template_folder='templates')\u000a\u000a@flat_pages.record\u000adef record(state):\u000a    db = state.app.config.get("flat_pages.db")\u000a\u000a    if db is None:\u000a        raise Exception("This blueprint expects you to provide "\u000a                        "database access through flat_pages.db")\u000a\u000a@flat_pages.route('/&lt;page&gt;')\u000adef show(page):\u000a    db = current_app.config["flat_pages.db"]\u000a    page_object = db.find_page_by_name(page)\u000a    return render_template('pages/{}.html'.format(page), page=page_object)\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>From this, there is nothing preventing you from providing a default implementation.</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>def setup_default_flat_pages_db(db):\u000a    class Page(db.Model):\u000a        name = db.Column(db.String(255), primary_key=True)\u000a        title = db.Column(db.String(255))\u000a        content = db.Column(db.String(255))\u000a\u000a        def __init__(self, name, title, content):\u000a            self.name = name\u000a            self.title = title\u000a            self.content = content\u000a\u000a    class FlatPagesDBO(object):\u000a        def find_page_by_name(self, name):\u000a            return Page.query.filter_by(name=name).first()\u000a\u000a    return FlatPagesDBO()\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>And in your configuration.</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>app.config["flat_pages.db"] = setup_default_flat_pages_db(db)\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>The above could be made cleaner by not relying in direct inheritance from db.Model and instead just use a vanilla declarative_base from sqlalchemy, but this should represent the gist of it.</p>\u000a

I hereby present my first ever python script:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>import sys, re\u000a\u000acss = open( sys.argv[1] , 'r' ).read()\u000a\u000a# remove comments - this will break a lot of hacks :-P\u000acss = re.sub( r'\u005cs*/\u005c*\u005cs*\u005c*/', "$$HACK1$$", css ) # preserve IE&lt;6 comment hack\u000acss = re.sub( r'/\u005c*[\u005cs\u005cS]*?\u005c*/', "", css )\u000acss = css.replace( "$$HACK1$$", '/**/' ) # preserve IE&lt;6 comment hack\u000a\u000a# url() doesn't need quotes\u000acss = re.sub( r'url\u005c((["\u005c'])([^)]*)\u005c1\u005c)', r'url(\u005c2)', css )\u000a\u000a# spaces may be safely collapsed as generated content will collapse them anyway\u000acss = re.sub( r'\u005cs+', ' ', css )\u000a\u000a# shorten collapsable colors: #aabbcc to #abc\u000acss = re.sub( r'#([0-9a-f])\u005c1([0-9a-f])\u005c2([0-9a-f])\u005c3(\u005cs|;)', r'#\u005c1\u005c2\u005c3\u005c4', css )\u000a\u000a# fragment values can loose zeros\u000acss = re.sub( r':\u005cs*0(\u005c.\u005cd+([cm]m|e[mx]|in|p[ctx]))\u005cs*;', r':\u005c1;', css )\u000a\u000afor rule in re.findall( r'([^{]+){([^}]*)}', css ):\u000a\u000a    # we don't need spaces around operators\u000a    selectors = [re.sub( r'(?&lt;=[\u005c[\u005c(&gt;+=])\u005cs+|\u005cs+(?=[=~^$*|&gt;+\u005c]\u005c)])', r'', selector.strip() ) for selector in rule[0].split( ',' )]\u000a\u000a    # order is important, but we still want to discard repetitions\u000a    properties = {}\u000a    porder = []\u000a    for prop in re.findall( '(.*?):(.*?)(;|$)', rule[1] ):\u000a        key = prop[0].strip().lower()\u000a        if key not in porder: porder.append( key )\u000a        properties[ key ] = prop[1].strip()\u000a\u000a    # output rule if it contains any declarations\u000a    if properties:\u000a        print "%s{%s}" % ( ','.join( selectors ), ''.join(['%s:%s;' % (key, properties[key]) for key in porder])[:-1] ) \u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>I believe this to work, and output it tests fine on recent Safari, Opera, and Firefox.  It will break CSS hacks other than the underscore &amp; /**/ hacks! Do not use a minifier if you have a lot of hacks going on (or put them in a separate file).</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Any tips on my python appreciated. Please be gentle though, it's my first time. :-)</p>\u000a

V<p>Your guess is correct - you understand <em>how</em> <code>classmethod</code>s work.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The why is that these methods can be called both on an instance OR on the class (in both cases, the class object will be passed as the first argument):</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>class Dummy(object):\u000a\u000a    @classmethod\u000a    def some_function(cls,*args,**kwargs):\u000a        print cls\u000a\u000a#both of these will have exactly the same effect\u000aDummy.some_function()\u000aDummy().some_function()\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>On the use of these on instances</strong>: There are at least two main uses for calling a classmethod on an instance:</p>\u000a\u000a<ol>\u000a<li><code>self.some_function()</code> will call the version of <code>some_function</code> on the actual type of <code>self</code>, rather than the class in which that call happens to appear (and won't need attention if the class is renamed); and</li>\u000a<li>In cases where <code>some_function</code> is necessary to implement some protocol, but is useful to call on the class object alone.</li>\u000a</ol>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>The difference with <code>staticmethod</code></strong>: There is another way of defining methods that don't access instance data, called <code>staticmethod</code>. That creates a method which does not receive an implicit first argument at all; accordingly it won't be passed any information about the instance or class on which it was called. </p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>In [6]: class Foo(object): some_static = staticmethod(lambda x: x+1)\u000a\u000aIn [7]: Foo.some_static(1)\u000aOut[7]: 2\u000a\u000aIn [8]: Foo().some_static(1)\u000aOut[8]: 2\u000a\u000aIn [9]: class Bar(Foo): some_static = staticmethod(lambda x: x*2)\u000a\u000aIn [10]: Bar.some_static(1)\u000aOut[10]: 2\u000a\u000aIn [11]: Bar().some_static(1)\u000aOut[11]: 2\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>The main use I've found for it is to adapt an existing function (which doesn't expect to receive a <code>self</code>) to be a method on a class (or object).</p>\u000a

V<p>There was a talk about using Python with robotics at this years <a href="http://pycon-au.org/2011/about/">PyConAU</a> called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PyConAU#p/u/17/nzCvomTixzU"><em>Ah! I see you have the machine that goes 'BING'!</em></a> by Dr. Graeme Cross.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The only option he recommended for using Python on a microcontroller board was <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyMite">PyMite</a> which I think also goes by the name of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip/">Python-On-A-Chip</a>. </p>\u000a\u000a<p>It has been ported to a range of boards - specifically he mentions the Arduino Mega which you said is not an option for you, but it is possible it is supported on other Arduino boards.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>However, because it is a "batteries not included" version of Python it is more than likely that you will have a real problem getting numpy/scipy etc up and running.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>As other posters have suggested, implementing in C might be the path of least resistence.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><em>Update:</em> again, not specifically for Arduino, but <a href="http://www.pymcu.com/overview.html">pyMCU</a> looks to provide python on a chip.  The author states he may look at developing an Arduino version of pyMCU if there is enough interest.</p>\u000a

V<p>Sometimes two classes may have some parameter names in common. In that case, you can't pop the key-value pairs off of <code>**kwargs</code> or remove them from <code>*args</code>.

V<p>@Sven's answer is the easy way, but it's rather inefficient for large arrays.  If you're dealing with a relatively small array, you won't notice the difference, if you're wanting a profile from a large (e.g. >50 MB) you may want to try a couple of other approaches. You'll need to work in "pixel" coordinates for these, though, so there's an extra layer of complexity.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>There are two more memory-efficient ways.  1) use <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.interpolation.map_coordinates.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates</code></a> if you need bilinear or cubic interpolation.  2) if you just want nearest neighbor sampling, then just use indexing directly.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>As an example of the first:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>import numpy as np\u000aimport scipy.ndimage\u000aimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\u000a\u000a#-- Generate some data...\u000ax, y = np.mgrid[-5:5:0.1, -5:5:0.1]\u000az = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) + np.sin(x**2 + y**2)\u000a\u000a#-- Extract the line...\u000a# Make a line with "num" points...\u000ax0, y0 = 5, 4.5 # These are in _pixel_ coordinates!!\u000ax1, y1 = 60, 75\u000anum = 1000\u000ax, y = np.linspace(x0, x1, num), np.linspace(y0, y1, num)\u000a\u000a# Extract the values along the line, using cubic interpolation\u000azi = scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates(z, np.vstack((x,y)))\u000a\u000a#-- Plot...\u000afig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2)\u000aaxes[0].imshow(z)\u000aaxes[0].plot([x0, x1], [y0, y1], 'ro-')\u000aaxes[0].axis('image')\u000a\u000aaxes[1].plot(zi)\u000a\u000aplt.show()\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T9MgR.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>\u000a\u000a<p>The equivalent using nearest-neighbor interpolation would look something like this:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>import numpy as np\u000aimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\u000a\u000a#-- Generate some data...\u000ax, y = np.mgrid[-5:5:0.1, -5:5:0.1]\u000az = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) + np.sin(x**2 + y**2)\u000a\u000a#-- Extract the line...\u000a# Make a line with "num" points...\u000ax0, y0 = 5, 4.5 # These are in _pixel_ coordinates!!\u000ax1, y1 = 60, 75\u000anum = 1000\u000ax, y = np.linspace(x0, x1, num), np.linspace(y0, y1, num)\u000a\u000a# Extract the values along the line\u000azi = z[x.astype(np.int), y.astype(np.int)]\u000a\u000a#-- Plot...\u000afig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2)\u000aaxes[0].imshow(z)\u000aaxes[0].plot([x0, x1], [y0, y1], 'ro-')\u000aaxes[0].axis('image')\u000a\u000aaxes[1].plot(zi)\u000a\u000aplt.show()\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T78B6.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>\u000a\u000a<p>However, if you're using nearest-neighbor, you probably would only want samples at each pixel, so you'd probably do something more like this, instead...</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>import numpy as np\u000aimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\u000a\u000a#-- Generate some data...\u000ax, y = np.mgrid[-5:5:0.1, -5:5:0.1]\u000az = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) + np.sin(x**2 + y**2)\u000a\u000a#-- Extract the line...\u000a# Make a line with "num" points...\u000ax0, y0 = 5, 4.5 # These are in _pixel_ coordinates!!\u000ax1, y1 = 60, 75\u000alength = int(np.hypot(x1-x0, y1-y0))\u000ax, y = np.linspace(x0, x1, length), np.linspace(y0, y1, length)\u000a\u000a# Extract the values along the line\u000azi = z[x.astype(np.int), y.astype(np.int)]\u000a\u000a#-- Plot...\u000afig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2)\u000aaxes[0].imshow(z)\u000aaxes[0].plot([x0, x1], [y0, y1], 'ro-')\u000aaxes[0].axis('image')\u000a\u000aaxes[1].plot(zi)\u000a\u000aplt.show()\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ex9AM.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>\u000a

Depending on the options, mysqldb fetch* keep the current set of rows in memory or server side, so fetchmany vs fetchone has some flexibility here to know what to keep in (python's) memory and what to keep db server side.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>PEP 249 does not give much detail, so I guess this is to optimize things depending on the database while exact semantics are implementation-defined.</p>\u000a

V<p>Python makes a lot of things easy and contains libraries and wrappers for a lot of common operations, but the goal is not to hide fundamental truths.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The fundamental truth you are encountering here is that you generally can't prepend data to an existing flat structure without rewriting the entire structure. This is true regardless of language.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>There are ways to save a filehandle or make your code less readable, many of which are provided in other answers, but none change the fundamental operation: You must read in the existing file, then write out the data you want to prepend, followed by the existing data you read in.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>By all means save yourself the filehandle, but don't go looking to pack this operation into as few lines of code as possible. In fact, never go looking for the fewest lines of code -- that's obfuscation, not programming.</p>\u000a

V<p>Why on earth would you make this a dictionary? What's the advantage? What happens if you later want to add some code?

V<p>That looks to be (almost) exactly what you want.  Two things:</p>\u000a\u000a<p>First, the results are a tuple of four items.  The third is the size of the bins.  The second is the starting point of the smallest bin.  The first is the number of points in the in or below each bin.  (The last is the number of points outside the limits, but since you haven't set any, all points will be binned.)</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Second, you'll want to rescale the results so the final value is 1, to follow the usual conventions of a CDF, but otherwise it's right.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Here's what it does under the hood:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>def cumfreq(a, numbins=10, defaultreallimits=None):\u000a    # docstring omitted\u000a    h,l,b,e = histogram(a,numbins,defaultreallimits)\u000a    cumhist = np.cumsum(h*1, axis=0)\u000a    return cumhist,l,b,e\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>It does the histogramming, then produces a cumulative sum of the counts in each bin.  So the ith value of the result is the number of array values less than or equal to the the maximum of the ith bin.  So, the final value is just the size of the initial array.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Finally, to plot it, you'll need to use the initial value of the bin, and the bin size to determine what x-axis values you'll need.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Another option is to use <code>numpy.histogram</code> which can do the normalization and returns the bin edges.  You'll need to do the cumulative sum of the resulting counts yourself.</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>a = array([...]) # your array of numbers\u000anum_bins = 20\u000acounts, bin_edges = numpy.histogram(a, bins=num_bins, normed=True)\u000acdf = numpy.cumsum(counts)\u000apylab.plot(bin_edges[1:], cdf)\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>(<code>bin_edges[1:]</code> is the upper edge of each bin.)</p>\u000a

V<p>From IEEE 1003.1:</p>\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u000a  <p>The mmap() function shall establish a\u000a  mapping between a process' address\u000a  space and a file, shared memory\u000a  object, or [TYM]   typed memory\u000a  object.</p>\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000a<p>It needs all the virtual address space because that's exactly what <code>mmap()</code> <em>does</em>.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The fact that it isn't <em>really</em> running out of memory doesn't matter - you can't map more address space than you have available.  Since you then take the result and access as if it <em>were</em> memory, how exactly do you propose to access more than 2^32 bytes into the file?  Even if <code>mmap()</code> didn't fail, you could still only read the first 4GB before you ran out of space in a 32-bit address space.  You can, of course, <code>mmap()</code> a sliding 32-bit window over the file, but that won't necessarily net you any benefit unless you can optimize your access pattern such that you limit how many times you have to visit previous windows.</p>\u000a

A trivially simple class, perhaps, but a class nonetheless:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>def foo(bar):\u000a    static my_bar # doesn't work\u000a\u000a    if not my_bar:\u000a        my_bar = bar\u000a\u000a    do_stuff(my_bar)\u000a\u000afoo(bar)\u000afoo()\u000a\u000a# -- becomes -&gt;\u000a\u000aclass Foo(object):\u000a    def __init__(self, bar):\u000a        self.bar = bar\u000a\u000a    def __call__(self):\u000a        do_stuff(self.bar)\u000a\u000afoo = Foo(bar)\u000afoo()\u000afoo()\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>If you want your function's behavior to change each time it's called, what you need is a generator:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>def foo(bar):\u000a    static my_bar # doesn't work\u000a\u000a    if not my_bar:\u000a        my_bar = bar\u000a\u000a    my_bar = my_bar * 3 % 5\u000a\u000a    return my_bar\u000a\u000afoo(bar)\u000afoo()\u000a\u000a# -- becomes -&gt;\u000a\u000adef foogen(bar):\u000a    my_bar = bar\u000a\u000a    while True:\u000a        my_bar = my_bar * 3 % 5\u000a        yield my_bar\u000a\u000afoo = foogen(bar)\u000afoo.next()\u000afoo.next()\u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>Of course, static variables <em>are</em> useful for quick-and-dirty scripts where you don't want to deal with the hassle of big structures for little tasks.

V<p>Do you understand list comprehensions? If so, a generator expression is like a list comprehension, but instead of finding all the items you're interested and packing them into list, it waits, and yields each item out of the expression, one by one.</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list = [1, 3, 5, 9, 2, 6]\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; filtered_list = [item for item in my_list if item &gt; 3]\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; print filtered_list\u000a[5, 9, 6]\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; len(filtered_list)\u000a3\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; # compare to generator expression\u000a... \u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; filtered_gen = (item for item in my_list if item &gt; 3)\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; print filtered_gen  # notice it's a generator object\u000a&lt;generator object at 0xb7d5e02c&gt;\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; len(filtered_gen) # So technically, it has no length\u000aTraceback (most recent call last):\u000a  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\u000aTypeError: object of type 'generator' has no len()\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; # We extract each item out individually. We'll do it manually first.\u000a... \u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; filtered_gen.next()\u000a5\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; filtered_gen.next()\u000a9\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; filtered_gen.next()\u000a6\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; filtered_gen.next() # Should be all out of items and give an error\u000aTraceback (most recent call last):\u000a  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\u000aStopIteration\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; # Yup, the generator is spent. No values for you!\u000a... \u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; # Let's prove it gives the same results as our list comprehension\u000a... \u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; filtered_gen = (item for item in my_list if item &gt; 3)\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; gen_to_list = list(filtered_gen)\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; print gen_to_list\u000a[5, 9, 6]\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; filtered_list == gen_to_list\u000aTrue\u000a&gt;&gt;&gt; \u000a</code></pre>\u000a\u000a<p>Because a generator expression only has to yield one item at a time, it can lead to big savings in memory usage. Generator expressions make the most sense in scenarios where you need to take one item at a time, do a lot of calculations based on that item, and then move on to the next item. If you need more than one value, you can also use a generator expression and grab a few at a time. If you need all the values before your program proceeds, use a list comprehension instead.</p>\u000a

V<p>From the python docs on <code>__import__</code>:</p>\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u000a<pre><code>__import__( name[, globals[, locals[, fromlist[, level]]]])\u000a</code></pre>\u000a  \u000a  <p>...</p>\u000a  \u000a  <p>When the name variable is of the form\u000a  package.module, normally, the\u000a  top-level package (the name up till\u000a  the first dot) is returned, not the\u000a  module named by name. However, when a\u000a  non-empty fromlist argument is given,\u000a  the module named by name is returned.\u000a  This is done for compatibility with\u000a  the bytecode generated for the\u000a  different kinds of import statement;\u000a  when using "import spam.ham.eggs", the\u000a  top-level package spam  must be placed\u000a  in the importing namespace, but when\u000a  using "from spam.ham import eggs", the\u000a  spam.ham subpackage must be used to\u000a  find the eggs variable. As a\u000a  workaround for this behavior, use\u000a  getattr() to extract the desired\u000a  components. For example, you could\u000a  define the following helper:</p>\u000a\u000a<pre><code>def my_import(name):\u000a    mod = __import__(name)\u000a    components = name.split('.')\u000a    for comp in components[1:]:\u000a        mod = getattr(mod, comp)\u000a    return mod\u000a</code></pre>\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>To paraphrase:</strong></p>\u000a\u000a<p>When you ask for <code>somepackage.somemodule</code>, <code>__import__</code> returns <code>somepackage.__init__.py</code>, which is often empty.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>It will return <code>somemodule</code> if you provide <code>fromlist</code> (a list of the variable names inside <code>somemodule</code> you want, which are not actually returned)</p>\u000a\u000a<p>You can also, as I did, use the function they suggest.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Note: I asked this question fully intending to answer it myself. There was a big bug in my code, and having misdiagnosed it, it took me a long time to figure it out, so I figured I'd help the SO community out and post the gotcha I ran into here.</p>\u000a
